Implementing the algorithms we learned in class, I was able to find out the runtime for Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort. 

The results are as follows:
For an array size of 50000: the insertion sort took 381 ms, bubble sort took 6391 ms, selection sort took 999 ms. For 100000: the insertion sort took 1462 ms, bubble sort took 27000, selection sort took 4203 ms. For 150000: insertion sort took 4585 ms, bubble sort took 53438 ms, selection sort took 9183 ms. 

From these results alone, we can conclude that insertion sort is the fastest, selection sort is the second fastest and bubble sort is the slowest.
